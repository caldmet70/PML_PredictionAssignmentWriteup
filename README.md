Practical Machine Learning: Peer Assessment - Prediction Assignment Writeup

This readme file is providing the discription of the course project writeup for the Practical Machine Learning.

## Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Data Set
The training data for this project are available here:

The test data are available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

## Submission

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which the exercise is done. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. Any of the other variables can be used to predict with. A report need to be created, which should describe how the model was built, how the cross validation was done, what is the expected out of sample error, and why these choices are made for this problem. The prediction models should also be applied to predict 20 different test cases.

1. Submission should consist of a link to a Github repo with a R markdown and compiled HTML file describing the analysis. the text should be within 2000 words with number of figures less than 5.
2. The machine learning algorithm need to be applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data. See the programming assignment for additional details.
